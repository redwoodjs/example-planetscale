# Redwood + Planetscale

This project has been deployed on 100% serverless infrastructure:

https://redwood-planetscale-example.netlify.app

> This project uses the `prisma migrate dev` flow, requiring a Shadow DB for local dev. This is not the flow recommended by Planetscale, but it is a more intuitive introduction for devs already using Redwood with Prisma.
### CLI: Planetscale and MySQL
Follow this guide:
- https://docs.planetscale.com/concepts/planetscale-environment-setup#macos-instructions

Be sure to login via `pscale auth login`

> **Note**
> We will use MySQL for local testing (optional), in which case we recommend installing mysql, which includes the mysql-client. For example on MacOS, to install mysql run `brew install mysql`
>
> Brew creates a `root` user (no password) and defaults to localhost. We'll use those for local dev and config. E.g. access msql shell via `msql -uroot`
## Setup
### Installation and Config
This project uses Yarn 3, dbAuth, and SQLite. You need to:
1. install packages
2. apply migrations to the dev DB
3. create a local dbAuth secret
4. create a local MySQL test DB (optional)
    - the test runner does not need a hosted DB; just use MySQL locally


Follow these steps:

```terminal
yarn install
echo "SESSION_SECRET=$(yarn --silent rw g secret --raw)" >> .env
mysql -uroot
mysql> create database planetscale_test;
```

>  **Note**
> The Test DB connection string for DB `planetscale_test` is already set in .env.defauls `TEST_DATABASE_URL`

### Planetscale DB Setup
For this example, we are using Planetscale for local dev as well as deployment. We are also using Prisma Migrate, which requires a Shadow DB branch. Reference:
- [Planetscale Prisma quick start](https://docs.planetscale.com/tutorials/automatic-prisma-migrations#quick-introduction-to-prisma's-db-push)
- [Prisma Planetscale quick start](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/using-prisma-with-planetscale)
- [Prisma Schema Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference)

#### Create the DB and Branches

Via the Planetscale Dashboard or CLI:
1. create a Planetscale DB
2. create two new branches from `main`: *shadow* and *development*

For the *shadow* and *development* branches, we need a connection string from the Dashboard:
1. Make sure you choose the "Connect with Prisma" option. And get a new user:password.
2. Copy the connection strings into `.env`
3. For the *shadow* branch, change the env var from `DATABASE_URL` to `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL`

Now we can apply the Prisma Schema to the *development* branch and seed the DB:
```terminal
yarn redwood prisma migrate dev
```

### Fire it up
Once everything is working, you're ready for local dev ðŸš€

```terminal
yarn rw dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/*`.

### Deployment

#### DB
Deployment with Planetscale is similar to a git pull and merge workflow. First, create a request to merge *development* into main. This can be done via the Dashboard or CLI:
```
pscale deploy-request create <database> development
```

Then approve and deploy via the Dashboard or CLI:
```
pscale deploy-request deploy <database> <deploy-request-number>
```

#### Hosting Provider
You can deploy to a provider of your choice, either serverles or traditional server. Because Planetscale is a serverless option, we chose Netlify for this example project:
```
yarn rw setup deploy netlify
```

We need to update the deploy command in `netlify.toml` to *not* run the Prisma deploy migration (it's already done in the previous Planetscale branch merge and deploy). Modify `netlify.toml`:
```diff
- command = "yarn rw deploy netlify"
+ command = "yarn rw deploy netlify --no-prisma"
```

Push your commits to a git repo, and then set up your site on the Netlify Dashboard. The last setting to manage is adding two Environment Variables:

**DATABASE_URL**
From the Planetscale dashboard, get the Prisma connection string for the *main* branch.

**SESSION_SECRET**
This project uses Redwood dbAuth for Authentication, which requires a secret. Run the following command:
```
yarn redwood generate secret
```

Then copy and paste the output as the value for the env var.
